<h1 id="mainTitle">auto's</h1><p class="text">We sell cars that drive around on four wheels. But some of our cars have three wheels and can still drive around. Our cars can drive slowly and quickly.</p> <br>
<p class="text">The cars that we sell can do anything that you want it to do if you want it to drive for at least 1 meter forward. We can promise that our cars will at least drive 1 meter. We will give you your money back if the car cannot drive at least 1 meter.</p> <br>
<p class="text">If you want something stupid like quality or insurance or legally owned cars then you shouldn't buy cars at out store. We will never do any of these things, we promise you that. We aren't like the big companies. We will never sell your information to other people. We won't even report you to the police!</p>
